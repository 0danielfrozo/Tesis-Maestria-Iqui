This first chapter presents and introduction and review of the main subjects which are relevant in the thesis. This review will help the reader to understand the vantguard of this subjects and how this thesis will contribute to knowledge in such areas. Initially   an overview on active packaging and its most common application, Oxygen Scavengers (OS), is presented in Section \ref{sec:act_pac} and \ref{sec:OS}. Next, a bibliographic research over Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) and Linseed oil oxidation kinetics is exposed in section \ref{sec:Linseed_Oxid.}. In section \label{sec:modeling}, a review about active packaging modeling, focused on OS material is presented. Here, a classification of the different modeling techniques used in literature is proposed. Consequently, models were classified as Homogeneous, Heterogeneous or multi-film.\\
Lastly, section \ref{sec:objectives} presents the general and specific objectives of this thesis followed by the strategy proposed to fulfil them.
