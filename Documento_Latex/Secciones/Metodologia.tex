In first place, the methodology followed to develop the numerical simulations (both for mono-layer to multilayer problem) is going to be stated. Afterwards, an explanation over how experimental data regarding $O_2$ uptake performance of the film was measured is going to be done. This data along with data obtained in literature was used to adjust kinetical parameters of linseed autoxidation reactions as well as to determine  initial concentrations of the substrate and hidroperoxides present in this substance. Finally methodology with respect to
